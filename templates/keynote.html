        Ella Mendoza, born Mariella Mendoza CÃ¡rdenas, is an undocumented educator, facilitator, visual artist, and writer. Originally from Lima, Peru; Ella currently lives in Salt Lake City, Utah.<br><br>

        Ella specializes on Education, and has worked with youth for over ten years, emphasizing on themes of race, culture, and heritage.<br><br>

        Through her displacement from her homeland, Ella has developed an anti-colonial abolitionist assessment of not just the political, but of the social; and her workshops focus on the natural and creative education of the self, when provided a space that challenges the artificial, and the plastic. Through her work, she honors the intergenerational value that comes from learning, and of adapting to change through ancestral survival.<br><br>

        A descendant of the Amazonas, and a child of the Mountains, Ella honors her roots by teaching in an anti-structural/anti-conventional medium, that questions the separation of art, education, and poetry.<br><br>

        Her work has been featured nationally, in both academic and hollistic settings, as a freelancer, as well as a representative of <a href="//familiatqlm.org/" target="_blank">Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement</a>, and <a href="//www.peacefuluprising.org/" target="_blank">Peaceful Uprising</a>.<br><br>
